# ðŸ“„ Sentence Analyzer

This project analyzes a sentence provided by the user to calculate:

- The **length** of the sentence (number of characters)
- The **number of words**
- The **number of vowels**

---

## ðŸš€ **Algorithm Overview**

### **Variables Used:**

- `sentence`: Stores the user-input sentence.
- `length_counter`: Counts the total number of characters.
- `word_counter`: Counts the number of words (initially set to 1).
- `vowel_counter`: Counts the number of vowels in the sentence.
- `vowels`: A string containing both uppercase and lowercase vowels (`"aeiouAEIOU"`).

---

## âš¡ **Step-by-Step Algorithm**

1. **Input**

   - Prompt the user: `"Enter the sentence ending with a period:"`
   - Store the input in `sentence`.

2. **Initialize Counters**

   - `length_counter = 0`
   - `word_counter = 1` _(Assumes at least one word exists)_
   - `vowel_counter = 0`

3. **Process Each Character**

   - **Loop** through each character in `sentence`:
     - **Count Characters:**
       - Increment `length_counter` by 1.
     - **Count Vowels:**
       - If the character exists in `vowels`, increment `vowel_counter` by 1.
     - **Count Words:**
       - If the character is a space (`" "`), increment `word_counter` by 1.

4. **Output Results**
   - Display the following:
     - `"Length of the sentence: [length_counter]"`
     - `"Number of words in the sentence: [word_counter]"`
     - `"Number of vowels in the sentence: [vowel_counter]"`
